==========
This is based on robotgrrl's android service for android accessory development kit / arduino board access.

The goal is to log sensor readings from the arduino shield to the internet.  See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ib9AaaeOI2wBcb4Nh78fd2SBsPtDRIUdz5MPtmXuZaQ/edit?usp=sharing for details

p.s. There are still issues with this version.  In fact, robotgrrl reported this same issue many years ago.  The service
runs well in the background.  But the connection to USB seems to not work consistently in the foreground application.
Anyone knowing the cause please contact the authors.
